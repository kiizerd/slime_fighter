make game fun

make guy attack

make enemies attack

give guy gun

collide guy and enemies and dont allow clipping

allow guy to get hit a few times and then die

track how many enemies guy has killed

enemies can spawn from 1 of 16 spawn points just outside the screen

enemies seek the player, get in attack range and attempt to attack him

enemy class needs "state" to check if it either, is attacking, has attacked, or can attack

guy should attack a little faster than enemies, allowing him to attack and dodge before being attacked

attacking locks guy and enemies from moving, or at least slows them down
